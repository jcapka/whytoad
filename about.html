  	<p>This site is silly, I get that.</p>
  	<p>I built it however to remind us that we need to ask &#8216;why&#8217; more often. I work in tech, and have
  	seen many projects lose direction, waste time, money and effort just because someone forgot to keep
  	asking why. There are fancy words like Governance, ROI, Vision and Mission, and I am happy to get
  	into more depth on these topics. I really enjoy it as a matter of fact. But it all starts with asking why.
  	Why this project? Why now? Why here? You get the picture. That's the &#8216;why&#8217; of this site.
  	I mean how silly if I didn't answer my own &#8216;why&#8217;. ;)</p>
  	<p>Sincerely, Joe Capka</p>
